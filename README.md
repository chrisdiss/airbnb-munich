## Motivation
<a name="motivation"/>

The objective of this analysis is to find insights in the AirBnB data from Munich. The project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree program Data Science. As AirBnB is a common way to travel and is especially attractive for low budget travels, one focus of this analysis will be to determine factors that influence the price of an AirBnB. By doing so I build a data model to predict the price of an accommodation. Next, for hosts one of the major sources for trust are the reviews. Therefore investigating variables that influencing a good review will be analyzed. After this I try to use the gained knowledge to find particular interesting AirBnB objects in Munich that have a price below the average but are still performing above the average in all the other categories.

The findings of the project are published here and in a blog article on medium.

## Findings
<a name="findings"/>

With my analysis of the shared data I found out that

The peak season is from June to August and are lowest is from January to March
The rates are higher on weekends
Apartments and Houses comprise of about 90% of total listings
Neighborhoods of Southeast Magnolia, Portage Bay and Westlake have highest mean price, while the neighborhoods of Rainier Beach, Olympic Hills and South Delridge have lowest mean prices
Broadway, Belltown and Wallingford have highest listing counts, while neighborhoods of Roxhill, South Park and Pinehurst have lower listing counts
Accommodation size (determined by number of bedrooms, how many people it accommodates, number of bathrooms) is by far the single biggest price influencer.
