## Installation
The code in the project can be executed using Anaconda distribution of Python ver 3.x and does not require any additional scripts.

## Project motivation
I took up writing this blog as part of second term of the nanodegree become a data scientist of Udacity. I was particular interested in identifying what are main factors influencing accomodation prices in Seattle to rent through Airbnb.

The findings of the project are publish in a blog here.

## File descriptions
There are 4 files available in the project

Readme.md (this file)
Seattle_airbnb.ipynb (the python Notebook)
Calendar.csv (data file about booking information in Seattle). Data source — https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data
Listings.csv (data file about Information about the houses in Seattle). Data source — https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

## Findings
With my analysis of the shared data I found out that

The peak season is from June to August and are lowest is from January to March
The rates are higher on weekends
Apartments and Houses comprise of about 90% of total listings
Neighborhoods of Southeast Magnolia, Portage Bay and Westlake have highest mean price, while the neighborhoods of Rainier Beach, Olympic Hills and South Delridge have lowest mean prices
Broadway, Belltown and Wallingford have highest listing counts, while neighborhoods of Roxhill, South Park and Pinehurst have lower listing counts
Accommodation size (determined by number of bedrooms, how many people it accommodates, number of bathrooms) is by far the single biggest price influencer.
